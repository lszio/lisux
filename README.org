#+TITLE: Lisux

My guix channel

* Usage

** via load-path

The simplest way to use this channel is to temporarily add it to Guix's
load-path:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git clone https://github.com/liszt21/lisux.git
guix install -L ./Lisux ***
#+END_SRC

** via channels.scm

A more permanent solution is to configure Guix to use this channel as an
_additional channel_. This will extend your package collection with
definitions from this channel. Updates will be received (and authenticated)
with `guix pull`.

To use the channel, add it to your configuration in
`~/.config/guix/channels.scm`:

#+BEGIN_SRC scheme
(cons* (channel
        (name 'lisux)
        (url "https://github.com/liszt21/lisux.git")
        (introduction
         (make-channel-introduction
          "d4ad130614963334f3f94a8b5f6ad7d1ba4eac3e"
          (openpgp-fingerprint
           "ABFC 5483 F3F7 1C39 922E  2E42 0EEA FA02 DA3C 7513"))))
       %default-channels)
#+END_SRC
